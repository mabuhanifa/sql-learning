To configure and start **MySQL** and **MySQL Workbench** on **Ubuntu**, follow these steps:

---

### üß± 1. **Install MySQL Server**

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install mysql-server
```

After installation, check if MySQL is running:

```bash
sudo systemctl status mysql
```

‚úÖ If it's inactive, start it:

```bash
sudo systemctl start mysql
```

And enable it to start on boot:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable mysql
```

- Remove anonymous users
- Disallow remote root login
- Remove test database
- Reload privilege tables

ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'your_password';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
EXIT;
```

---

### üß∞ 4. **Install MySQL Workbench**

```bash
sudo apt install mysql-workbench
```

If it's not available from apt or outdated, use snap:

To create a **database called `movieDB`** in MySQL, follow these steps:

---

### üìå Option 1: Using MySQL CLI

1. Open terminal:

```bash
mysql -u root -p
```

2. Once inside the MySQL shell, run:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE movieDB;
```

3. To check if it was created:

```sql
SHOW DATABASES;
```

4. To use it:

```sql
USE movieDB;
```

5. Then you can start creating tables, e.g.:

```sql
CREATE TABLE movies (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  title VARCHAR(255),
  release_year INT
);
```

---

### üìå Option 2: Using MySQL Workbench

1. Open MySQL Workbench
2. Connect to your MySQL server (local or remote)
3. In the **Navigator** panel on the left:
   - Right-click **Schemas**
   - Choose **Create Schema**
4. In the popup:
   - **Name**: `movieDB`
   - Click **Apply**, then **Apply** again to execute the SQL
   - Click **Finish**

You‚Äôll now see `movieDB` listed under **Schemas**. Right-click and set it as default if you want to work within it.

Let me know if you'd like help creating tables or inserting sample data into `movieDB`.
