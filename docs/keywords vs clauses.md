Great question! In MySQL (and SQL in general), **keywords** and **clauses** are related but serve different roles. Here's a clear breakdown of the two:

---

### 🔑 **Keywords**

- These are **reserved words** in MySQL that have special meaning in the SQL language.
- They are used to define and construct SQL statements.
- Think of them as the **building blocks** or **vocabulary** of SQL.

#### ✅ Examples of MySQL Keywords:

- `SELECT`
- `FROM`
- `WHERE`
- `INSERT`
- `UPDATE`
- `DELETE`
- `JOIN`
- `GROUP`
- `ORDER`
- `LIMIT`
- `AS`
- `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`
- `NULL`
- `IN`, `LIKE`

### 📄 **Clauses**

- Clauses are **components or sections** of an SQL statement.
- A clause is typically made up of **one or more keywords**, plus expressions, tables, or conditions.
- Clauses come together to form a complete SQL query.

#### ✅ Examples of SQL Clauses:

- `SELECT` clause → defines which columns to retrieve.
- `FROM` clause → specifies the tables to retrieve data from.
- `WHERE` clause → filters rows based on conditions.
- `GROUP BY` clause → groups rows that have the same values.
- `ORDER BY` clause → sorts the result set.
- `HAVING` clause → filters grouped rows.
- `LIMIT` clause → restricts the number of rows returned.

### 🔁 Relationship

- **Keywords** are like **words**.
- **Clauses** are like **sentences** made from those words.

#### Example:

```sql
SELECT name, age      -- SELECT clause (uses keyword SELECT)
FROM users            -- FROM clause (uses keyword FROM)
WHERE age > 21        -- WHERE clause (uses keyword WHERE)
ORDER BY age DESC;    -- ORDER BY clause (uses keywords ORDER, BY, DESC)
```
